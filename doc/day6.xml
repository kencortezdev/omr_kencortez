      Creating the Home Page

    <step>
      <para>
        Go to the root of the project
      </para>

    <step>
      <para>
        Run <sgmltag>$ rails server</sgmltag>
      </para>
      <para>
        This will obviously need to be done whenever we are running the project off of our machine
      </para>
    </step>

    <step>
      <para>
        Received and error when running <sgmltag>$ rails server</sgmltag> from cygwin (I wonder if this is just a cygwin problem)
      </para>
      <para>
        Just tried running <sgmltag>$ bundle install</sgmltag> from cygwin and seeing some new "Installing" messages
      </para>
      <para>
        It is currently held up on <sgmltag>Installing pkg-config 1.1.7</sgmltag>
      </para>
      <para>
        Nevermind - this worked! It just took a really long time.
      </para>
      <para>
        Next time add verbose output with <sgmltag>$ bundle install -V</sgmltag>
      </para>
      <para>
        Attempting to run <sgmltag>$ rails server</sgmltag> again...
      </para>
      <para>
        Success! It worked!
      </para>
      <para>
        Additionally, it looked like it installed a bunch of new packages.  I do not know why these were missed the last time I ran <sgmltag>$ bundle install</sgmltag> the last time with GitBash.
      </para>
    </step>

    <step>
      <para>
        Keep the server running, and in another instance of terminal, create a home page by entering <sgmltag>$ rails generate controller pages home</sgmltag>
      </para>
