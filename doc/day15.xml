    <step>
      <para>
        Run the command <sgmltag>$ rails generate devise user</sgmltag>
      </para>
      <para>
        No colons
      </para>
      <para>
        To undo what you just did, just run <sgmltag>$ rails destroy devise user</sgmltag>
      </para>
      <para>
        Any time you run "generate" you should also be able to run "destroy"
      </para>
    </step>

    <step>
      <para>
        Inside of the app, a user model is now added
      </para>
      <para>
        A user was created, but now a migration needs to be run
      </para>
      <para>
        Migrations must be run to sync the database - rails has an MVC architecture
      </para>
      <para>
        The model is the thing that interacts with the Database
      </para>
      <para>
        When we ran the command in the previous step, we created a "migration"
      </para>
      <para>
        We need to sync the "model" with the "database" and we do this with Rails' "migrations", and we have to "run the migrations" in order to sync the database
      </para>
      <para>
        Whenever we have created a model that changes the model, we must run a migration.  This is how rails works
      </para>
      <para>
        The user model was created in the last step, now run <sgmltag>rake db:migrate</sgmltag>
      </para>
    </step>


    <step>
      <para>
        I got tons of errors in the last step because my version of the Devise gem was out of date
      </para>
      <para>
        Changed the gemfile to: <sgmltag>gem 'devise', '~&gt; 3.4.0' </sgmltag>
      </para>
      <para>
        Then run <sgmltag>$ bundle install</sgmltag>
      </para>
      <para>
        The migration file should now have the correct <sgmltag>*.rb</sgmltag> tag
      </para>
    </step>


    <step>
      <para>
        Kill the server and restart it: <sgmltag>$ rails server</sgmltag>
      </para>
    </step>


    <step>
      <para>
        Migrations only apply to one Database!
      </para>
      <para>
        This works in development and not yet production (Heroku)
      </para>
      <para>
        We will need to run a similar process when we do this in production
      </para>
    </step>
